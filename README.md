## Project Name: The Recital

## Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.

The project is a website that follows the conversation between two friends, Alpha and Shamma, as they adress the myths and facts surroundsing anxiety as experienced by Alpha. The concept and theme of the project is an audio book with a unique spin derived from our imressions of the name "audio book" A shared impression derived from the literal translation of the name is a book that gives out sound. Therefore, in designing the website that our project would live on as well as deciding on how the content would be displayed and constructed, we decided to to mimic a book...... 

## Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.
Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version
